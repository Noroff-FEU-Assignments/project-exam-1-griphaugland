## Description

When reading the exam assignment I was a bit unsure what type of blog I wanted to create. I spent a few days creating designs in Figma with various types of blogs. One weekend I was making lunch and I googled the recipe for American Pancakes. There I found the inspira:on for what type of blog to create. A food blog with a target audience of students. Cheap, fast and healthy food for students with little time and money.

I looked for inspira:on for the blog through various websites linked in references.
For the color scheme I chose a dark green and a bright pink. The green to portray health and growth and the pink as it was a an elegant color that I found fiGng to the green. I wanted to create a website where there could be created new recipes aHer the fact and they would fit in just like the ones I created for the project.
